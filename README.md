# SparseNN

This package provides Neural Network modules supporting sparse data using Torch (future support for sparse models would be desired)

### Motivation
When it comes to neural networks, the support for sparisity is often limitted to input layers only (e.g. [SparseLinear](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/simple.md#nn.SparseLinear)). This repository is intended for development of NN modules supporting sparsity in various layers.
